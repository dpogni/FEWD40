				<h2>Chakra Name</h2>
				<p>Sahasrara (Sanskrit: सहस्रार, IAST: Sahasrāra, English: “thousand-petaled”) or crown chakra is generally considered to be the state of pure consciousness, within which there is neither object nor subject. When the Kundalini energy rises to this point, it unites with the male Shiva energy, and a state of liberating samadhi is attained. Symbolized by a lotus with one thousand multi-coloured petals, it is located either at the crown of the head, or above the crown of the head. Sahasrara is represented by the colour white and it involves such issues as inner wisdom and the death of the body.</p>
